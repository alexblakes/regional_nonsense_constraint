    "### Transcript set\n",
    "One representative transcript (the Ensembl_canonical transcript) was selected for every protein-coding gene in the GENCODE v39 annotion [REF]. In total, 19,982 transcripts were identified. 18,600 of these are the MANE Select transcript (MANE v0.95) [REF]. The remaining 1,382 transcripts, in genes which lack a MANE annotation, are the APPRIS principal isoform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotating NMD regions\n",
    "For each transcript, the following NMD regions were annotated with custom Python scripts:\n",
    "- Start-proximal: The first 150nt downstream of the translation start site\n",
    "- Long exon: Positions >400nt upstream of an exon-intron junction\n",
    "- 50nt rule: The most 3' 50nt in the penultimate (second-most 3') exon\n",
    "- Last exon: Positions in the final (most 3') exon\n",
    "- NMD target: Any position within a CDS lacking the annotations above  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Last exon\" and \"50nt rule\" annotations were unified into one category: \"Distal\". Positions with multiple NMD annotations were assigned one definitive annotation, with this priority: \n",
    "start-proximal > distal > long exon. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variant identification\n",
    "Variants were identified from coding exome sequencing (CES)[REF] data in the UK Biobank (UKB)[REF]. The sequencing methods have been previously described[REF]. Variants were filtered through the gnomAD sample and variant quality control (QC) pipeline[REF]. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in our transcripts of interest, which passed all variant filters (FILTER=\"PASS\") and had a minimum allele count of 1, were extracted from the 421,212 samples which passed sample-level QC. In total, 10,836,767 SNVs meeting these criteria were identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    The gnomAD QC pipeline may require more description. Is it identical to the ExAC pipeline?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutability-adjusted proportion of singletons\n",
    "We obtained allele counts for every SNV identified above. After VEP annotation (see below, \"Modelling the expected number of variants\"), we calculated the proportion of singletons for each consequence (synonymous, missense, nonsense) and each NMD region (see above, \"Annotating NMD regions\") using custom Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for sequence mutability, we built a weighted least squares model ([Figure S4](#maps_model)) describing the relationship between mutability and the proportion of singletons for synonymous variants in each variant context. The model was weighted by the number of observed synonymous variants in each variant context. CpG transitions (accounting for ~3% of all possible synonymous variants) were excluded from this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each functional variant class, we used the model to predict the expected proportion of singletons. The observed proportion of singletons was then adjusted by this number to find MAPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling the expected number of variants\n",
    "This analysis was based on the methods described by the gnomAD group [REF].\n",
    "\n",
    "Each genomic position in our transcripts of interest was annotated with its trinucleotide context (the reference base on the + strand, plus the bases immediately adjacent to it) using BCFtools **[version]** and reference genome **[reference genome]**. Each possible variant context (64 trinculeotide contexts * 3 possible alternative alleles = 192 variant contexts) was annotated with the per-base, per-generation mutation rate (\"mutability\") described in Chen et al. 2022 [REF].\n",
    "\n",
    "Every possible coding SNV in our transcripts of interest were annotated with the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) v105 [REF] (Ensembl v105, consistent with MANE v0.95 and GENCODE v39). For each SNV, the consequence was annotated against all available transcripts. Subsequently, the VEP output was filtered to our transcripts of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    This is not the case currently. Instead, I have used the VEP --pick, --pick_order, and --coding_only flags. This is a potential source of error. When we refactor the code and rerun the analysis, I should run this as above.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the expected number of variants in any arbitrary sequence in this cohort, we constructed a weighted least-squares regression model describing the relationship between mutability and the proportion of possible synonymous variants observed for each variant context. The model was weighted by the number of possible synonymous variants in each variant context. CpG transitions (accounting for ~3% of all possible synonymous variants) were excluded from this model and from the remainder of the constraint analysis (see [Figure S1](#expectation_model))\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    More discussion on this will be given in the supplementary information. I think a sensible approach would be to build separate models for non-CpG and CpG variants, and to apply them separately to each transcript.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the expected number of variants in each transcript and region, we summed the mutability of every possible variant context for each transcript and NMD region (described above). We then applied our model to predict the expected number of synonymous, missense, and nonsense variants per transcript and NMD region. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional nonsense constraint\n",
    "To identify constrained transcripts and regions, we performed a one-sided Z-test comparing the proportion of nonsense variants observed (obs) with the proportion of nonsense variants expected (exp) for each transcript and region. We tested the null hypothesis that the proportion of observed nonsense variants is equal to or greater than the proportion of expected nonsense variants in each transcript and region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcripts and regions which are poorly covered may appear depleted of nonsense variants (false positives). Because coverage summary statistics were not available, we used the proportion of synonymous variants observed as a proxy for coverage. We excluded those transcripts and regions in which the proportion of synonymous variants observed was more than one standard deviation below the proportion of synonymous variants expected (synonymous Z score < -1). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    The current synonymous filter is for >= 10 synonymous variants and synonymous Z-score > -1. I should amend this to just the Z-score.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "After correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg (false discovery rate (FDR)) method, we defined constrained transcripts and regions as those with fewer nonsense variants than expected (one-tailed Z test, P < 0.001), or those with 0 nonsense variants observed and P < 0.01. This second group represents transcripts at the limit of our power to detect constraint. To acheive a significance level of P < 0.01 or P < 0.001 (prior to FDR correction), a minimum of ~5 or ~9 expected nonsense variants are required, respectively. To exclude very large transcripts with modest constraint but highly significant P-values, we excluded transcripts and regions where the ratio of observed : expected variants (O/E) was larger than 0.35. \n",

    "We identified coding positions in which a premature termination codon (PTC) may evade NMD in 19,982 canonical human transcripts. Using four previously-described NMD escape rules [REF], we annotated positions which were start-proximal (<150nt downstream of the translation start codon), at the 5' end of long exons (>400nt upstream of a splice donor site), subject to the 50nt rule (within the most 3' 50nt of the penultimate exon) or in the final exon of the transcript. Positions in the latter two groups are collectively refered to as \"distal NMD escape\" positions. In total, 13,214,649 coding positions (38.7% of the coding exome) are subject to one or more of these NMD escape rules ([Table 1](#nmd_table), [Figure 1](#nmd_figure))\n",

    "### Nonsense variants in NMD regions are highly constrained\n",
    "To identify variant-level constraints, we calculated the mutability-adjusted proportion of singletons (MAPS) for nonsense variants in NMD escape regions using coding exome sequencing data in 421,212 individuals in the UKB. MAPS is a constraint metric which uses shifts in the allele frequency spectrum to highlight functional variant classes which are under negative selection ([REF]). Nonsense variants in all regions of the transcript are highly constrained ([Figure 2](#maps)), but there is  variability by NMD region. Interestingly, nonsense variants in the 5' end of long exons are the most highly constrained (MAPS = 0.132), even more so than nonsense variant which are likely to be targeted by NMD (MAPS = 0.116). By contrast, distal and start-proximal nonsense variants are less highly constrained (MAPS = 0.080, 0.077 respectively).\n",

    "To examine selective constraint against nonsense variants at the transcript level, we trained a variant expectation model [REF] on coding exome sequencing data from 421,212 individuals in the UK Biobank [REF]. The model, based on the mutation rate of SNVs in a given  trinucleotide context, explains **[95.9%]** of the variance in the proportion of observed rare synonymous variants exome-wide ([SF]).\n",

    "We applied this model to predict the number of synonymous, missense, and nonsense variants expected in this cohort in each canonical transcript.

Our transcript-level nonsense Z-scores are highly correlated with the gnomAD LOEUF metric [REF] (Spearman$\\rho$ = 0.77, P < 2.23 x 10$^{-308}$) ([Figure S2](#z_vs_loeuf)).\n",
