## Materials and Methods
### Transcript set
For consistency of annotation, one representative transcript (the Ensembl_canonical transcript) was selected for every protein-coding gene in the GENCODE v39 annotion [^1]. In total, 19,982 transcripts were identified. 18,600 of these are the MANE_Select transcript (MANE v0.95). The remaining 1,382 transcripts, in genes which lack a MANE annotation, are the APPRIS principal isoform.

### Annotating NMD regions
The following NMD regions were annotated with custom Python scripts:
