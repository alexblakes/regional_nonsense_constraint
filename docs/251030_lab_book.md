## Intersecting constrained regions and Pfam domains
Some domains have overlaps that are larger than the regions themselves.
This can happen, for example, when there are multiple domains with identical names which overlap. 
See for example the tetraspanin domain in TSPAN2.

This could be addressed in the original bed files.
Otherwise the logic may be challenging.
