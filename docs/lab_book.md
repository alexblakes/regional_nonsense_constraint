GHR (growth hormone receptor) as an interesting case.
It has a long last exon.
The last exon entirely contains the (presumably critical) growth hormone receptor binding domain.
The last exon is strongly depleted for nonsense variants, but does include a number of frameshift variants.
Some of these frameshift variants occur at reasonably high allele frequencies.

"A head-to-head comparison with GeneBayes rather misses the point."
